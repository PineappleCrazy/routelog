Hiya,


This program will generalise certain criteria to make running more efficient and the program easier to manage. Here's what you need to know:


Airlines generalised under their host companies - Eg. EasyJet Switzerland and EasyJet Europe routes all stored under main EasyJet. Same applies for RYR, NOZ, ABY, etc.


Longterm wetleases (eg Helvetic with Swiss) will be considered full, whereas short term leases will not be included.


Aircraft types are grouped to avoid repetitive flying. The categories are:
A320, A330, A350, B737, B777, B787, EJET (embraer 170-195)

Routes are only included if they have at least one valid aircraft flying them. 


Current supported regions consist of the following nations:

- Austria
- Belgium
- Bosnia & Herzegovina
- Croatia
- Cyprus
- Czechia
- Denmark
- Estonia
- Finland
- France (partially supported)
- Germany
- Hungary
- Iceland
- Ireland
- Latvia
- Lithuania
- Luxembourg
- Netherlands
- Norway
- Poland

Thanks for all support,
